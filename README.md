# DRL_Navigation_Robot_ROS2_Foxy
 Deep Reinforcement Learning for mobile robot navigation in ROS Gazebo 11 simulator. Using Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) neural network, a robot learns to navigate to a random goal point in a simulated environment while avoiding obstacles. Obstacles are detected by laser readings and a goal is given to the robot in polar coordinates. Trained in ROS Gazebo 11 simulator with PyTorch. Tested with ROS2 Foxy on Ubuntu 20.04 with python 3.8.10 and pytorch 1.10.
